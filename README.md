A simple small student project to train with some libs, and have some fun trying to make the best code possible.

Run the program:
./my_goflife [-h]


-h: Opens the help page

# What is the game of life ?
The game of life is a simple "living cells" simulation, in a grid, which is divided in cells, defined as empty or full,
the user (or else) fill some cells and run the simulation, each cell follow simple rules as it follows:
- An empty cell surrounded by 2 full cells becomes full
- A full cell surrounded by less than 2 others dies of loneliness
- A full cell surrounded by more than 3 cells dies of suffocation

# Why is it interesting ?
- To learn, and really improve my skills
- To learn to optimize more and more
- To observe the behavior of these small cells :)

As usual, feel free to look at the code, and all i have done !
